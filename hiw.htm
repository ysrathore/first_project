<h1><b>What are Holland Codes? What is RIASEC?</b></h1>
<img src="ho.jpg" style="margin-left:404px;">
<p>



Holland Codes and the abbreviation RIASEC refer to John Holland's six personality types: 
Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional. 
Career Key organizes and scientifically classifies careers, college majors, career clusters, and career pathways by these personality types.
</p><br><br>
<p>
For a description of each type and how you can use 
personality-career and personality-major match to increase 
career satisfaction and academic success, visit our article on Holland's Theory of Career Choice. Our advice on how to choose a career and how to choose a major are based on this popular, respected theory.
</p><br><br>
<p>
For an accurate assessment of all six Holland Codes, 
take The Career Key's career test. Instead of giving 
results as three-letter codes and alphabetical lists of careers,
 our unique matching system enables you to identify careers and
 college majors that match your set of interests, traits, skills and abilities.
